Red Hat IoT Demo Kit
=
This project contains the Asset Tracking Demo showcasing Red Hat technologies used in IoT solutions. This is a RHEL VM based gateway with the Eclipse Kura intelligent gateway software installed, as well as a JBoss EAP web application for monitoring sensor data.

Once you follow the directions below in "Getting Started", you will have a running VM containing the 
following components that make up the IoT Asset Tracking Demo:
- Kura intelligent gateway
	- Sensor components
	- Connector to Everyware Cloud
- JBoss EAP 7
	- Asset Tracking demo web UI
	- JBoss Data Grid

## Prequisites
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox

**_Note: These instructions are for running this demo on Mac - you can [use homebrew to install prerequisites](https://github.com/ishuverma/demo-kit/blob/Ishu's-edits/homebrew.md). For running this demo on RHEL, follow [these](http://xxx) additional steps_**

Getting Started
==
1. In a console, clone this repository and change to the project directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/redhat-iot/demo-kit.git
$ cd demo-kit
```

2. Download JBoss EAP 7 (jboss-eap-7.0.0.zip) and JBoss Data Grid Server 7 (jboss-datagrid-7.0.0-server.zip) from [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=appplatform&downloadType=distributions) and save these to `files/`
3. Download Kura build and make it executable
```
$ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/redhat-iot/kura_2.1.0-SNAPSHOT_fedorapi_installer.sh -o files/kura_2.1.0-SNAPSHOT_fedorapi_installer.sh
$ chmod +x files/kura_2.1.0-SNAPSHOT_fedorapi_installer.sh 
```

4. Create a private configuration file from template
```
$ mkdir $HOME/.vagrant.d
$ cp redhat-iot-demo.yml $HOME/.vagrant.d/redhat-iot-demo.yml
```
Edit new file as needed (default should be ok unless you are doing Kura development).

Starting the Demo VM
==
To start the VM, run the following command:
```
vagrant up
```
Once the VM has started, the installed application will be available through these links:

|Application Links|
|-----------------|
|[Red Hat IoT Cargo Demo](http://localhost:8081)|
|[Kura Web Console](http://localhost:8080)|
|[Everyware Cloud](https://console-sandbox.everyware-cloud.com)|


To stop the VM and destroy it completely, run:
```
vagrant destroy
```

Installing components to Kura
==
Once you have the VM running, you can access the [Kura web console](http://localhost:8080) and login as admin/admin.

In the Kura UI, click on the "Packages" menu and then select "Install/Upgrade". Select the com.redhat.iot.demo.package_1.0.2-SNAPSHOT.dp file from vagrant/files. This installs the main demo components.

Due to a bug in Kura, to reinstall new versions you must first manually Uninstall the package and then install the new version in two steps.

Once you have installed the component above, open a browser to http://localhost:8081 and click on one of the shipment lines to start visualizing the sensor data. Sensor data does not start streaming to the UI until you click on a shipment.


Troubleshooting
==
If the VM stops at the lines:
```
==> redhat-iot-demo: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    redhat-iot-demo: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
    redhat-iot-demo: SSH username: vagrant
    redhat-iot-demo: SSH auth method: private key
```
for more than 3 minutes, you can use CTRL-C to cancel the build, and then run `vagrant destroy` to clean up. Run `vagrant up` to try the VM build again. This is a known issue, but if the VM doesn't start after trying 2-3 times, please open an issue. If you have a possible solution or input on the problem, please open an issue as well.


Additional commands to know are:

|Command|Function|
|-------|--------|
|vagrant up|Creates a new VM from the template|
|vagrant suspend|Suspends the VM without destroying it (resume with vagrant resume)|
|vagrant resume|Resume a suspended VM|
|vagrant destroy|Destroy the VM completely (Use if you want to create a new one|
|vagrant provision|Run the provisioners on the existing VM.|
|vagrant ssh|Uses the private keys installed in the VM to establish an ssh session|
